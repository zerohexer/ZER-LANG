# Emit audit — catches dead-stub pattern in emitted C.
#
# Background: on 2026-04-18 audit of the IR transition, zerc_main.c was
# found printing "/* forward */ " at the start of every multi-module
# output before the real header. The stub wrote the comment prefix but
# never emitted the payload it was documenting. Tests passed because
# `/* forward */` is valid C (just a noop comment). The emitted output
# was polluted for ~4 weeks undetected.
#
# This script compiles a handful of multi-module ZER programs and
# greps the emitted C for known dead-stub fingerprints. Exit non-zero
# if any are found.
#
# Run from repo root: bash tools/emit_audit.sh
# Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = stray markers found.

# Known dead-stub markers. Add new fingerprints here when audits
# find more dead stubs. The pattern is: a comment-only fprintf that
# never gets the payload filled in. Finds them all.
#
# Ordinary comments (headers, function docs) are filtered out by
# restricting to specific short stubs.
